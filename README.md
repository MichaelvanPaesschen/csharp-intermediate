# C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP


Sample code for all the exercises from the [C# Intermediate: Classes, Interfaces and OOP](https://www.udemy.com/csharp-intermediate-classes-interfaces-and-oop/learn/v4/overview)
course made by [Mosh Hamedani](https://github.com/mosh-hamedani) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

## Section 2 - Classes

In this section you will learn about classes, constructors, methods, fields, acess modifiers, properties, indexers and 
how to initialize an object.

### Design a Stopwatch

Design a class called Stopwatch. The job of this class is to simulate a stopwatch. It should provide two methods: 
Start and Stop. We call the start method first, and the stop method next. Then we ask the stopwatch about the duration 
between start and stop. Duration should be a value in TimeSpan. Display the duration on the console.

We should also be able to use a stopwatch multiple times. So we may start and stop it and then start and stop it again. 
Make sure the duration value each time is calculated properly.

We should not be able to start a stopwatch twice in a row (because that may overwrite the initial start time). So the 
class should throw an InvalidOperationException if its started twice.

Educational tip: The aim of this exercise is to make you understand that a class should be always in a valid state. 
We use encapsulation and information hiding to achieve that. The class should not reveal its implementation detail. 
It only reveals a little bit, like a blackbox. From theoutside, you should not be able to misuse a class because you 
shouldn’t be able to see the implementation detail. 

### Design a StackOverflow Post

Design a class called Post. This class models a StackOverflow post. It should have properties for title, description 
and the date/time it was created. We should be able to up-vote or down-vote a post. We should also be able to see the 
current vote value. In the main method, create a post, up-vote and down-vote it a few times and then display the the 
current vote value.

In this exercise, you will learn that a StackOverflow post should provide methods for up-voting and down-voting. You 
should not give the ability to set the Vote property from the outside, because otherwise, you may accidentally change 
the votes of a class to 0 or to a random number. And this is how we create bugs in our programs. The class should always 
protect its state and hide its implementation detail.

Educational tip: The aim of this exercise is to help you understand that classes should encapsulate data AND behaviour 
around that data. Many developers (even those with years of experience) tend to create classes that are purely data 
containers, and other classes that are purely behaviour (methods) providers. This is not object-oriented programming. 
This is procedural programming. Such programs are very fragile. Making a change breaks many parts of the code.

## Section 4 - Inheritance: Second Pillar of OOP

In this section you will learn how do access modifiers and constructors affect inheritance, what is upcasting vs 
downcasting, and boxing vs unboxing.

### Design a Stack

A Stack is a data structure for storing a list of elements in a LIFO (last in, first out) fashion.
Design a class called Stack with three methods.
```
void Push(object obj)
object Pop()
void Clear()
```
The **Push()** method stores the given object on top of the stack. We use the “object” type here so we can store any 
objects inside the stack. Remember the “object” class is the base of all classes in the .NET Framework. So any types 
can be automatically upcast to the object. Make sure to take into account the scenario that null is passed to this 
object. We should not store null references in the stack. So if null is passed to this method, you should throw an
InvalidOperationException. Remember, when coding every method, you should think of all possibilities and make sure the 
method behaves properly in all these edge cases. That’s what distinguishes you from an “average” programmer.

The **Pop()** method removes the object on top of the stack and returns it. Make sure to take into account the scenario 
that we call the Pop() method on an empty stack. In this case, this method should throw an InvalidOperationException. 
Remember, your classes should always be in a valid state and used properly. When they are misused, they should throw 
exceptions. Again, thinking of all these edge cases, separates you from an average programmer. The code written this way
will be more robust and with less bugs.

The **Clear()** method removes all objects from the stack.

We should be able to use this stack class as follows:
```
var stack = new Stack();
stack.Push(1);
stack.Push(2);
stack.Push(3);
Console.WriteLine(stack.Pop());
Console.WriteLine(stack.Pop());
Console.WriteLine(stack.Pop());
```

The output of this program will be
```
3
2
1
```

**Note**: The downside of using the object class here is that if we store value types (eg int, char, bool, DateTime) in 
our Stack, boxing and unboxing occurs, which comes with a small performance penalty. In my C# Advanced course, I’ll 
teach you how to resolve this by using generics, but for now don’t worry about it.

**Real-world use case**: Stacks are very popular in real-world applications. Think of your browser. As you navigate the 
web, the address of each page you visit is stored in a stack. As you click the Back button, the most recent address is 
popped. This is because of the LIFO behaviour of stacks. 

## Section 5 - Polymophism: Third Pillar of OOP

### Design a database connection

To access a database, we need to open a connection to it first and close it once our job is done. Connecting to a 
database depends on the type of the target database and the database management system (DBMS). For example, connecting 
to a SQL Server database is different from connecting to an Oracle database. But both these connections have a few 
things in common.

- They have a connection string
- They can be opened
- They can be closed
- They may have a timeout attribute (so if the connection could not be opened within the timeout, an exception will be thrown).
Your job is to represent these commonalities in a base class called DbConnection. This class should have two properties:

ConnectionString : string
Timeout : TimeSpan

A DbConnection will not be in a valid state if it doesn’t have a connection string. So you need to pass a connection 
string in the constructor of this class. Also, take into account the scenarios where null or an empty string is sent 
as the connection string. Make sure to throw an exception to guarantee that your class will always be in a valid state.

Our DbConnection should also have two methods for opening and closing a connection. We don’t know how to open or close 
a connection in a DbConnection and this should be left to the classes that derive from DbConnection. These classes 
(eg SqlConnection or OracleConnection) will provide the actual implementation. So you need to declare these methods 
as abstract.

Derive two classes SqlConnection and OracleConnection from DbConnection and provide a simple implementation of opening 
and closing connections using Console.WriteLine(). In the real-world, SQL Server provides an API for opening or closing 
a connection to a database. But for this exercise, we don’t need to worry about it.
